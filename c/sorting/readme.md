# Sorting
## Merge Sort
### Mergesort is a comparison-based algorithm that focuses on how to merge together two pre-sorted arrays such that the resulting array is also sorted.
	1. Worst case time complexity is O(nLogn)
	2. Average case time complexity is O(nlogn)
	3. Best case time complexity is O(nlogn)
	4. Space complexity is O(n)

## Bubble Sort
### Bubble sort is a comparisonâ€‹-based algorithm thatcompares each pair of elements in an array and swaps them if they are out of order until the entire array is sorted. For each element in the list, the algorithm compares every pair of elements.
	1. Worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
	2. Average case time complexity is O(n^2)
	3. Best case time complexity is O(n)	
	4. Space complexity is O(1)
